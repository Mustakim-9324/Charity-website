        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Prologue: What Made Us?</h2>
        <p class="lead">As being a part of a large chunk of the part which drives our Indian Economy, this part is called by our Society as Middle Class.
We, as part of Middle Class, just hear of big inspiring terms like Entrepreneurship, Millionaire, Billionaire, Rich, Dreams, Goals, but when we finally 
decide to do something like this, then we realise we have to go a long away to achieve this. It's a daily struggle to keep the handful of money but we always 
learn a lesson that expenses are more than income. We are the main reasons Credit Card companies are surviving in short. Well ,this is not connect the dots because
all these are not sequential thoughts to make sense in a linear way. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Pandemic Says SURPRISE!</h2>
        <p class="lead">We were keeping hope to get out of this daily struggle and then we got hit by Pandemic of Covid in 2019. Lockdowns were imposed for our safety and many of us were not able to earn their daily bread, major migration happened. We heard about many stories about Lockdown struggles over Social Media, News , Gossips. But this made me question my conscience when my close relative was facing the financial crisis during this Pandemic Lockdown. Somehow, I managed to help him financially by contributing with the help of my colleagues and friends. This got me to think that why don't we exploit the major significance of our country to help our nation during this difficult time.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Thanks to Population and Digital Payments.</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Significant thing I am referring to is our population. As thanks to our Demonitization Policy, India was redirected towards the path of Online and Digital Payment method.
This Digital Payment method and Fast Internet connectivity can make all of us to contribute for unfortunate people who were affected during this time.

Why should we use Google Pay only to get Cashbacks for ourselves, let's give those cashbacks to other, because of this Others will definetly have luck and that too 
not next time, it will be now. Will you join me to start a small yet revolutionary change?

So, this bits and parts made us what we are today. And Thank you for walking along with us </p>
